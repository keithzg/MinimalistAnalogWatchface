# Minimalist Analog Watchface (for Android Wear / Wear OS)
This is a watchface built off of just modifying Google's example analog watchface for Wear, but stripping it down even a bit more to make it basically look like the Android analog clock widget does.

I was surprised to see that Android Wear (now "Wear OS") doesn't ship with any Google-provided watchfaces. On my Android homescreen I've long had Google's very minimalist analog clockface, and I had been assuming that that'd be an option on Wear. To make matters even worse, the watch shipped with a watchface called "Minimalist Analog Watchface" which was, if anything, quite busy and detailed! So, I made this.
